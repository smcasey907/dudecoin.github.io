                <h1>What's the Dude?</h1>
                <p>DUDE is a community-driven, decentralized token, created as an homage to the legendary Jeffrey Lebowski.</p>
                <p>The Dude's laid-back, easy-going attitude and refusal to adhere to societal norms are what we were looking for in a crypto community, but that isn't always easy to find.</p>
                <p>So, we made it...</p>
                <p>Lebowski is the opposite of almost everything in the crypto space, and that is what draws us to the character. Where most tokens will try to convince you that they are the next sure thing, we are going to be honest and tell you we are not even sure what we are doing. How's that for transparency and honesty?</p>
                <p>The $DUDE token is for people like The Dude.</p>
                <p>DUDE is built on the Solana blockchain which allows for fast and secure transactions. The token was minted on Dexlab. The original liquidity was created as a USDC pair on Dexlab, then burned. Liquidity has since been expanded to a network of projects, most notably $FRN (Free Ross Now).</p>
                <p>The token is available on JUP and Birdeye, and can be purchased with USDC or SOL.</p>
